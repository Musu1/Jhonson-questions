# Question-3

Misha is very fond of Fibonacci numbers, so her brother decided to give her the following problem:

She is given an array  of  integers. Her task is to print the output generated by the following code:

F(A):

    ans = 0

    for i = 0 to A.length()
       for j = 0 to A.length()
          for k = 0 to A.length()
             ans = ans + fibonacci(A[i] + A[j] - A[k])

    return ans mod 1000000007
It is guaranteed that  for any three indices  chosen randomly in the input array.

Note: Fibonacci numbers follow this recurrence:

 

Input format

The first line of the input contains a single integer  denoting the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains a single integer  denoting the number of integers in the array.
The second line of each test case contains  space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array  .
Output format

For each test case, print the answer in a single line.
